  <p>You, the monster killer, want to kill a group of monsters. The monsters are on a tree with $n$ vertices. On vertex with number $i$ ($1\le i\le n$), there is a monster with $a_i$ attack points. You want to battle with monsters for $10^{100}$ rounds.</p>
  <p>In each round, the following happens in order:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>All living monsters attack you. Your health decreases by the sum of attack points of all living monsters.</li>
   <li>You select some (possibly all or none) monsters and kill them. After being killed, the monster will not be able to do any attacks in the future.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is a restriction: in one round, you cannot kill two monsters that are directly connected by an edge.</p>
  <p>If you choose what monsters to attack optimally, what is the smallest health decrement you can have after all rounds?</p>

  <p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). Description of the test cases follows.</p>
  <p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 3\cdot 10^5$).</p>
  <p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ ($1\le a_i\le 10^{12}$).</p>
  <p>The following $n-1$ lines each contain two integers $x,y$ ($1\le x,y\le n$), denoting an edge on the tree connecting vertex $x$ and $y$.</p>
  <p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3\cdot 10^5$.</p>

  <p>In the first test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex $1$, so your health decreases by $10^{12}$. Then kill the monster on vertex $1$.</li>
   <li>In the second round to the $10^{100}$-th round: all monsters have been killed, so nothing happens.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The total health decrement is $10^{12}$.</p>
  <p>In the second test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex $1,2,3,4,5$, so your health decreases by $47+15+32+29+23=146$. Then kill the monsters on vertex $1,4,5$.</li>
   <li>In the second round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex $2,3$, so your health decreases by $15+32=47$. Then kill the monsters on vertex $2,3$.</li>
   <li>In the third round to the $10^{100}$-th round: all monsters have been killed, so nothing happens.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The total health decrement is $193$.</p>
  <p>In the third test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$, so your health decreases by $8+10+2+3+5+7+4=39$. Then kill the monsters on vertex $1,3,6,7$.</li>
   <li>In the second round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex $2,4,5$, so your health decreases by $10+3+5=18$. Then kill the monsters on vertex $2,4,5$.</li>
   <li>In the third round to the $10^{100}$-th round: all monsters have been killed, so nothing happens.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The total health decrement is $57$.</p>
